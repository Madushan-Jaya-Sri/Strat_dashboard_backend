  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Effective Date]</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>[Your Company Name]</strong> ("we", "our", "us") collects, uses, stores, and deletes Platform Data and other data for the internal Momentro dashboard hosted at <em>eyqi6vd53z.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com</em>.</p>
    <p>This dashboard is for <strong>internal use only</strong> (employees and authorized contractors) and is not offered to the public.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>Platform Data</strong> — data obtained from Meta APIs (Graph API) such as Ads Insights, Campaign metrics, Page/Instagram metrics, audience aggregates, and metadata tied to business accounts. This <em>does not</em> include the items excluded by Platform Terms 3(e).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Platform Data from Meta Graph API (ads insights, campaign stats, page/instagram metrics) — only as permitted by granted permissions.</li>
      <li>Account/email used to access the dashboard (for authentication and audit).</li>
      <li>Operational logs and performance metrics (for debugging and platform health).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How We Use Platform Data</h2>
    <p>Platform Data is used only to render internal reports, perform analytics, monitor campaign performance, and support internal business decision-making. No advertising or data sharing outside authorized internal users.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Storage, Caching & Transfer</h2>
    <p>All Platform Data is stored in our secure cloud database(s). We do not store Platform Data on organizational or personal devices (laptops, phones, removable drives). Data in transit uses HTTPS/TLS. Access to stored Platform Data is restricted by role-based access controls and MFA for permitted accounts.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain Platform Data only as long as it is necessary for legitimate business purposes (e.g., to display dashboard metrics, run internal reports, or comply with legal/audit obligations). Typical retention periods are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cached/processed dashboard data: up to 90 days by default (configurable).</li>
      <li>Audit logs: up to 1 year or as required by regulation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If Platform Data is no longer necessary, it is deleted or irreversibly anonymized.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>User Data Deletion Requests</h2>
    <p>If an internal user (or an authorized account owner) requests deletion of Platform Data associated with their account, they may request it by:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Using the dashboard: <em>Settings → Privacy & Data → Delete My Data</em>, which triggers automated deletion for the account's Platform Data; or</li>
      <li>Emailing support at <strong>support@yourcompany.com</strong> with the account identifier. We will authenticate the request and delete associated Platform Data within <strong>30 days</strong> unless legal hold applies.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="note">Note: Platform Data listed in Platform Terms 3(e) are excluded from this policy per Meta's definitions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We maintain industry-standard protections: encrypted storage at rest, HTTPS/TLS for all network traffic, role-based access control, MFA for privileged accounts, and periodic security patching of code and infrastructure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not share Platform Data with third-party vendors except where required for hosting, backups, or tooling. Any such provider is contractually required to maintain equivalent data protection and only process data on our instruction.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. Changes will be posted here with an updated effective date.</p>
  </div>
